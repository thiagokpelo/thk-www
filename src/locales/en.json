In the meantime I attended an ObjC Course which made me relate to the area of code and logic. I‚Äôve made some projects regarding Hybrid Apps on Cordova and Ionic framework. I have some experience with PHP (OOP) using Symfony framework on admin projects and creating Rest APIs to be consumed on Front-end with Angular and jQuery. I also have built many institutional websites with HTML5, CSS3, JS , PHP and MySQL. I worked for a few months with Asp.Net MVC with SQL Server database and later my team and I changed the server language from C# to NodeJs and we consumed the API written on Java. On this project we recreated the whole server on Node with HapiJs framework making calls to SQL Server and through API and on client we utilized Angular with Nunjucks template rendering. I have been specializing as a Fullstack developer attending back-end courses such as .NetCore, ReactNative, Flutter, GraphQL, among others. Nowadays I am on a front-end team that works with multi languages and I‚Äôm always studying new technologies for my professional growth."
